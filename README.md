# so_long

## Description

So_long is a program that creates a 2D game. It is made from _scratch_ with the
help of [MLX42](https://github.com/codam-coding-college/MLX42/tree/da6e42050b299e61aa2d96e5f08ac178c000514c).

It must have:

- A player.
- An exit.
- At least one collectible.
- Walls.

The goal is to gather every collectible to open the exit, which is initially
closed.

### Bonus

- Add enemies, and the player loses when it touches any of them.
- Add sprite animations.
- Display the movement count on the screen.
